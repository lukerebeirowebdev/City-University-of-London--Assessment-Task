The `code`fetch()`code` function is used to make a network request to the specified URL https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/photos. This URL is an example endpoint that returns a JSON array of photos.

The fetch() function returns a Promise that resolves to the response from the server. We can then chain .then() methods to handle the response.

The first .then() method takes the response object and calls its .json() method to parse the response body as JSON. This returns another Promise that resolves to the parsed JSON data.

The second .then() method takes the parsed JSON data and performs some actions with it. In this case, it iterates over each photo object in the data using the forEach() method.

Inside the forEach() loop, it creates an img element using the document.createElement() method. This element represents an image.

It sets the src attribute of the img element to photo.thumbnailUrl. This assumes that each photo object in the data has a property called thumbnailUrl that contains the URL of the photo thumbnail.

It retrieves the container element with the ID photos-container using the getElementById() method.

It appends the img element to the container element using the appendChild() method. This adds the image to the container, effectively displaying it on the webpage.

If any error occurs during the fetching or processing of the data, the code uses the .catch() method to handle the error. In this case, it simply logs the error message to the console.

Overall, this code fetches a list of photos from a JSON API, creates image elements for each photo, and appends them to a container on the webpage.
